# jlox - lox interpreter implemented in java

this is my progress through crafting interpreters. it's so much fun writing along. to use the build script, just add Lox as the argument to the build script, as in, `./build.sh Lox`. To make the jar, just `./build-jar.sh` after you have first built the classes.
